Hi Everyone ,<br> 

I am Palash Mohan , studying in Nahar International school in Grade 5. You  might have realised already , that this website is about games.<br> 
Gaming is my favorite thing to do in free time , so here i am introducing my favorite games and sharing my knowledge about them .<br>

Games are designed specifically for the purpose of educating children ,can motivate self learning and problem-solving skills to a great extent.<br> ... 
Game-Based Learning plays important role in teaching by making students to collaborate, communicate, interact and work in teams.<br> 
Strategic games improve the functioning of brain<br>

<b><h3>SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I FEEL IT IS GOOD TO PLAY GAMES!</h3></b><br>

1. Better Decision Maker <br>

2. Video Games Can Make You Less Anti-Social<br>
One of the worst stereotypes associated with playing video games is that those who do are awkward social rejects.
Even if there plenty of basement-dwelling gamers out there, that doesnâ€™t mean all gamers have problems socializing in public and making friends.
Researchers from three different institutions in the UK and Canada recently did their own studies to find out how common antisocial behavior is among gamers.
What each one discovered is that gamers who partake in live social environments are actually the most communicative and friendly people there.

3. Games Can Enhance Your Ability To Learn<br>
Contrary to popular belief that video games make you bad at school, researchers from the UK found that certain video games can actually enhance our brain flexibility.

4. Improved Focus and Attention.<br>

5. Help Improve Hand-Eye Coordination.<br>
